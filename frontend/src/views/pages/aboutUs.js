            <p>
              I grew up with the aroma of freshly made coffee <br>
              every morning as my Mum and Nona made that every <br> 
              day coming from a big Italian family. My coffee van <br> 
              dream was born after a visit to see my Grandfather <br> 
              in Minori, Italy. His love of coffee and serving his <br>
              community inspired me to do the same here in Perth. <br>
              I've been serving great coffee and delicious savoury <br>
              and sweet treats from my quirky coffee van since <br>
              August 2024. I look forward to meeting you soon.<br><br>
